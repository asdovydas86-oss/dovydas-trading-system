# FMITS Product Backlog

**Living document.** The current execution board: what is being built now, what comes next, what is
blocked, and why each item matters to the product.

**Not a roadmap.** [`reports/0005`](reports/0005_2026-08-01_FMITS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP_2026_2027.md)
remains the strategic roadmap and is immutable. This board changes as work moves.

**Not an architecture document.** Boundaries live in the ADRs and
[`reports/0003`](reports/0003_2026-08-01_FMITS_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT_V1.md).

| Field | Value |

| **Last verified against** | `a728f3b9f1dbf70c3e00fcfb97b66d60872f8ece` (Milestone AL) |
| **Verified on** | 2026-08-04 |
| **Verification method** | live repository + `git log` + full test run + accepted ADRs |

## 1. Purpose and usage rules

This board answers one question at a time: **what are we building, and what will the owner be able
to do when it lands?**

**Product-first rule.** FMITS is developed product-first. Every milestone must either

- deliver measurable user value, **or**
- remove a clearly identified blocker preventing measurable user value.

Every item on this board answers: *"What can the owner do after this milestone that was impossible
before?"* An item that cannot answer it does not belong here.

**Usage.**

- Read §4 first — it is the only section that states verified fact.
- §5 (NOW) holds exactly one active milestone.
- Status is never inferred from a roadmap or a vision document. **Only the repository and accepted
  ADRs can move an item to DONE.**
- When a milestone completes, move it to §8 with its commit SHA, and record it in
  [`FMITS_PRODUCT_CHANGELOG.md`](FMITS_PRODUCT_CHANGELOG.md) only if it changed what the owner can do.

## 2. Status definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **NOW** | Actively being built. Exactly one, unless §11 rule 5 applies |
| **NEXT** | Approved, sequenced, and unblocked once NOW completes |
| **LATER** | In scope, not yet sequenced. Grouped by epic |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot start until a named precursor exists. The precursor is always stated |
| **DONE** | Verified in the repository: code merged, tests passing, ADR accepted |
| **DEFERRED** | Deliberately postponed with a recorded reason. Not abandoned |
| **OPEN DECISION** | Scope or approach undecided. Carried, not solved, until the owner rules |

## 3. Priority definitions

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Blocks the product, or removes a correctness/capital risk |
| **High** | Directly enables a workflow the owner performs or wants to perform |
| **Medium** | Broadens coverage or quality of an existing capability |
| **Low** | Valuable, removable, no dependant work |

### Current user-visible capability

```
fmits daily  BTCUSDT ETHUSDT SOLUSDT       # the morning routine, one row per symbol
fmits swing  BTCUSDT                       # the whole page, end to end
fmits regime BTCUSDT --multi               # the environment, per role, with evidence
fmits mtf    BTCUSDT -n 260                # 1W context · 1D setup · 4H execution
fmits facts  BTCUSDT --interval 4h         # one timeframe, exhaustively
python -m fmis.pipeline daily BTCUSDT      # works without reinstalling
```

`daily` runs the **same** swing analysis across a requested universe, one symbol at a time, and
prints a compact **readiness index**: one row per symbol, in the order requested, carrying the
decision-context state and the regime beside it. A symbol that fails reports why and does not stop
the run. It is **not a ranking** — no score, no direction, no recommendation — and the first
limitation printed on every run says exactly that.

`swing` is the **whole page in one command**: data quality, regime per role, structure per role,
levels, evidence by family, and the disagreements between them — with risk, portfolio, trade plan and
AI interpretation rendered as explicitly unavailable, each naming the milestone that owns it and the
inference its absence forbids.

`regime` classifies three **environments** — structure, volatility and participation — each with the
evidence behind it, the evidence against it, what was unavailable, and the exact policy that produced
it. It is **not a direction**: `trending` does not mean rising. Under `--multi` each role is
classified alone and nothing is derived from the combination.

`mtf` returns three **role-labelled** views of one instrument, each with its own `as_of` and
staleness, their structural trends side by side and nothing derived from the combination.

`facts` returns a deterministic fact sheet for **one instrument on one timeframe**: EMA/RSI/MACD/ATR with
warm-up status, relative volume, swing points, structural labels, structural trend, price levels,
level crossings, break of structure, change of character, nearest level above and below the last
close, and the inherited limitations — computed from live exchange data.

**This is the whole product surface today.** Everything else in the repository is a library beneath it.

---

## 5. NOW

Exactly one item.

### `AO` — Memory / decision archive

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **ID** | AO *(was AM until two milestone-letter shifts — §11)* |
| **Epic** | EP-18 Knowledge & Research |
| **Status** | **NOW** |
| **Priority** | **Critical** |
| **Estimated size** | *(source: reports/0005 Phase 5)* |
| **Confidence** | Blocked-dependent — **open decision D-01 must be settled first** |

**Product value.** Closes the loop. Four of the project's nine success criteria depend on it.

**What the owner can do after this that was impossible before.** Ask *"what did I think about this in
October, and was I right?"* and get an answer. Until this exists, daily use accumulates nothing.

**Why now.** AN made the case concrete rather than theoretical: a daily run is now a first-class,
schema-versioned object holding real workspaces, so what would be archived is already decided. AK and
AN both raised the same open decision (`Workspace` and `DailyRun` are equally unpicklable), and it is
the same answer for both.

**Dependencies.** AN (done) **and OPEN DECISION D-01 (persistence schema)**, which must be settled
before implementation begins.
**Related.** `PROJECT_SPECIFICATION_V1.md` §25 · `reports/0004` C-159 · `reports/0005` Phase 5.

> **Not started.** No persistence code exists in the repository.

## 6. NEXT

The forced sequence. Each item is blocked on the one above it.

*AN shipped; the memory / decision archive moved to NOW. §6 is empty until D-01 is settled and the
item after the archive is sequenced — see §7 for the epics awaiting sequencing.*

---

## 7. LATER — epics

In scope, not yet sequenced. One line per epic states what it delivers and what gates it.
Detail lives in `reports/0004` (capabilities) and `reports/0005` (phasing) — not restated here.

| ID | Epic | Delivers | Status | Priority | Gated by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EP-01** | Technical Analysis & Market Structure | Support/resistance scoring, pattern detection, composite features, remaining indicators (RSI MA, MACD slope, ADX, Bollinger, VWAP), divergences | Partly DONE | High | — |
| **EP-02** | Swing Trading Product | Scanning, ranking, trade plan, confirmation/invalidation, stop and target logic, post-trade review | LATER | High | AJ |
| **EP-03** | Daily Market Intelligence | Global Market Pulse, Daily Brief, opportunity scanner, alerts, scheduling | LATER | High | AK |
| **EP-04** | Portfolio & Risk | Positions, exposure, correlation clustering, total open risk, position sizing, Buying Power | LATER | **Critical** | **D-02 money types** |
| **EP-05** | Multi-Asset Data Platform | Calendars and sessions, second adapter family, equities/ETFs/indices/commodities | LATER | High | Calendar layer |
| **EP-06** | Long-Term Investing | Thesis capture, thesis monitoring, valuation context, catalysts, position role | LATER | Medium | EP-04, EP-08 |
| **EP-07** | Macro & News Intelligence | Central-bank policy, rates, liquidity, calendar, news mechanism analysis, geopolitics | **BLOCKED** | Medium | **D-03 availability-time model** (ADR-0003) |
| **EP-08** | Fundamental Research | Business/protocol fundamentals, filings, valuation | **BLOCKED** | Medium | **D-03** |
| **EP-09** | China Intelligence | HKEX/mainland, A/H/ADR links, PBOC, policy, capital flows, sector tracks | LATER | Medium | EP-05 |
| **EP-10** | IPO & Special Opportunities | IPO calendar, new ETFs, M&A, spin-offs, lockups, index changes | LATER | Low | EP-05 |
| **EP-11** | Crypto On-Chain | Exchange flows, stablecoins, cohorts, realized metrics, unlocks, **provenance** | LATER | Medium | Adapters |
| **EP-12** | Derivatives | Funding, open interest, liquidations, basis, options, positioning | LATER | Medium | Adapters |
| **EP-13** | Strategy Laboratory | Rule specs, registry, versioning, frozen datasets, sensitivity | LATER | Medium | `compute_series()` |
| **EP-14** | Backtesting | Historical replay with fees/slippage, out-of-sample, walk-forward, robustness, regime segmentation | LATER | Medium | EP-13 |
| **EP-15** | Paper Trading | Simulated fills on unseen data, identical sizing/risk logic to live | LATER | Medium | EP-14 |
| **EP-16** | Shadow Mode | Live data, real timing, **executes nothing** | LATER | Medium | EP-15 |
| **EP-17** | Controlled Execution | Live orders under hard limits, kill switch, full logging, no withdrawal permission | LATER | Low | EP-16 + explicit human decision |
| **EP-18** | Knowledge & Research | Decision archive, journal, searchable knowledge base, lessons learned | LATER | **Critical** | **D-01 persistence schema** |
| **EP-19** | Reporting & Delivery | Dashboard, structured reports, exports, notifications, transports | LATER | Low | AK |
| **EP-20** | Security & Operations | CI, type checking, system health, observability, AI budget, safety controls | LATER | Medium | **D-07 CI timing** |

**Bounded autonomous day trading** is deliberately **not** an epic on this board. It sits beyond
EP-17 and beyond the autonomy boundary that `reports/0003` §7.5 records as not crossed and not
designed. It requires its own vision decision (**D-14**, **D-15**) before it can be scheduled.

---

## 8. DONE

Repository-verified only. Every SHA below was confirmed to exist with `git cat-file -e`.

The **complete** 30-milestone history lives in
[`docs/AI_HANDOFF/CURRENT_STATE.md`](docs/AI_HANDOFF/CURRENT_STATE.md) and is not duplicated here.
This section carries the four most recent product-relevant milestones.

### `AN` — Deterministic Daily Workflow v1 · **DONE**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`74036a4b81967618a809e420b85d320ab566d6b5`** |
| **ADR** | none — no new boundary was created. `fmis.daily` composes AK and AL under ADR-0007's existing application-layer rule, and the review records why an ADR was not warranted |
| **Design** | [DETERMINISTIC_DAILY_WORKFLOW_V1.md](docs/design/DETERMINISTIC_DAILY_WORKFLOW_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [DETERMINISTIC_DAILY_WORKFLOW_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/DETERMINISTIC_DAILY_WORKFLOW_V1_REVIEW.md) — no P0, no P1, **2 P2 fixed**, 1 P3 fixed, 3 P3 documented |
| **Tests** | 3,766 → **3,905** (+139). Mutation 81/81, zero survivors, zero no-ops |

**Product value delivered.** A repeatable morning routine. Before AN every capability answered about
one symbol; an owner watching eight instruments ran eight commands and read eight ~270-line pages.
`fmits daily` runs the same analysis across a universe and prints **83 lines for fifty symbols**.

**What the owner can now do that was impossible before.** Analyse a whole watchlist in one command,
under one set of settings, and see at a glance which analyses rest on enough data — and, critically,
**which symbols failed and why**. Before AN a symbol whose fetch failed was a command that scrolled
past; nothing recorded that it had been skipped.

**Limitations shipped with it, printed on every run.** It is an index, not a ranking · a
decision-context state is not an opportunity · each symbol is fetched at a different instant, so the
run has **no shared as-of** and rows are not comparable in time · a failed symbol gets no substituted
cached analysis.

**Deviation from the boarded acceptance criteria — recorded, not quietly dropped.** The board's line
read *"A scheduled run produces a brief without interaction · scanning **ranks** a watchlist on
computed facts with stated reasons · every run is **archived** · failures are visible."* The
milestone brief explicitly forbade scheduling, ranking and persistence. AN therefore delivers the
multi-symbol routine and **failures are visible**; scheduling belongs to no architecture layer yet,
and archiving is `AO`, blocked on D-01. Three of Phase 4's four completion criteria are therefore
**still open**, carried by `EP-02`, `EP-03` and `AO` — not met, and not withdrawn.

**On ranking, precisely.** Two different things were being named by one word, and only one of them is
refused:

- **Ranking by readiness is a category error, permanently.** A decision-context state describes the
  *analysis*, not the instrument, so sorting by it produces a list of picks out of a list of data
  qualities. This is the design §3.4 argument, and it binds every future version of the daily index.
- **Ranking opportunities remains a named FMITS capability, and is deferred, not withdrawn.**
  `PROJECT_SPECIFICATION_V1.md` §10 lists *market scanning* and *candidate ranking* among the Swing
  Trading Module's responsibilities, and its **Opportunity Scanner** *"ranks possible long-term
  investments, swing trades and later short-term trades"*; `PROJECT_VISION_ADDENDUM_V1.md` carries the
  same scanner; `reports/0005` Phase 4 carries **C-164 opportunity scanning over a watchlist**; and
  this board's own **`EP-02`** (scanning, ranking) and **`EP-03`** (opportunity scanner) rows in §7
  remain LATER · High. None of that is affected by AN.

When a scanner is built it must rank on an **explicit, deterministic, testable and backtested
policy** — a named milestone with its own ADR, evidence and acceptance criteria — never as a side
effect of a workflow, and never on a readiness state.

**Status note.** DONE on repository evidence: the suite is green under `-W error`, coverage is 100 %
on all four new modules and on `pipeline/cli.py`, mutation is 81/81 with byte-identical source
restoration, the review is complete with every P0–P2 fixed, and `fmits daily` was run against live
Binance data including a deliberately invalid symbol.

### `AL` — Decision Context Engine v1 · **DONE**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`a728f3b9f1dbf70c3e00fcfb97b66d60872f8ece`** |
| **ADR** | [ADR-0026](docs/adr/ADR-0026-decision-context-boundary.md) |
| **Design** | [DECISION_CONTEXT_V1.md](docs/design/DECISION_CONTEXT_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [DECISION_CONTEXT_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/DECISION_CONTEXT_V1_REVIEW.md) — no P0, no P1, **2 P2 fixed**, 3 P3 |
| **Tests** | 3,702 → **3,766** (+64). Mutation 43/43, zero survivors |

**Product value delivered.** The page now says whether it can be trusted. Measured before the work
began: a 12-candle page and a 260-candle page rendered nearly identically, because a section's status
reports whether it produced output rather than whether the output is sound. 12 candles now reads
**insufficient**, 40 **limited**, 260 **sufficient**.

**What the owner can now do that was impossible before.** See, in one line, whether an analysis rests
on enough data — and when it does not, exactly which requirement is unmet and which layer decided.

**Why this preceded the daily workflow.** That milestone's named principal risk is an unfiltered brief.
The filter is this judgement, and building it inside the brief would have meant extracting it later.

**Limitations shipped with it.** The judgement is made about the primary timeframe · `SUFFICIENT`
means the data each layer asked for is present, not that the reading is correct · `strict` is one
flag, deliberately not a per-requirement override.

**Status note.** DONE on repository evidence: the commit exists, the suite is green under `-W error`,
coverage is 100 % on all four new modules, mutation is clean, the review is complete and all four
real-data surfaces work.

### `AK` — Swing Trading Workspace v1 · **DONE**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`8121050b9d36a22f9a20995c98c5be1206911c33`** |
| **ADR** | **none** — the implementation proved no new architectural decision |
| **Design** | [SWING_WORKSPACE_V1.md](docs/design/SWING_WORKSPACE_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [SWING_WORKSPACE_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/SWING_WORKSPACE_V1_REVIEW.md) — no P0, no P1, **5 P2 fixed**, 3 P3 |
| **Tests** | 3,582 → **3,702** (+120). Mutation 49/49, zero survivors |

**Product value delivered.** `fmits swing BTCUSDT` is the whole analysis in one command, replacing
three commands and a chart. It also made the **third stranded island reachable**:
`fmis.decision_support`, `fmis.evidence` and `fmis.trading_context` — 1,131 statements of accepted,
tested, ADR-governed code — had zero production importers before this milestone.

**What the owner can now do that was impossible before.** Read one page that states the facts, the
environment, the evidence, **what disagrees**, and **what it cannot tell you** — with risk, portfolio,
trade plan and AI interpretation rendered as explicitly unavailable rather than quietly absent.

**How the page stays honest.** An unbuilt section names the milestone that owns it and the inference
its absence forbids. Conflicts are reported and never resolved. Nothing on the page is a
recommendation, and no direction is expressed or implied.

**Limitations shipped with it.** `AK-1` evidence is price-derived only, and four of ten families
carry no descriptor · `AK-2` conflicts are reported, never resolved · `AK-3` risk, portfolio, trade
plan and interpretation are not computed · `AK-4` evidence and levels describe the primary timeframe.

**Status note.** DONE on repository evidence, as §11 rule 3 requires: the commit above exists, the full
suite is green under `-W error`, coverage is 100 % on every workspace module, mutation is clean, the
independent review is complete and all four real-data surfaces work.

### `AJ` — Swing Trading Workspace architecture · **DONE** *(design only)*

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **none** — delivered as an architecture specification, not as repository code |
| **Outcome** | The section-registry design `AK` implements. Its substance is recorded in [the AK design](docs/design/SWING_WORKSPACE_V1.md) |

**Product value delivered.** None directly, and it says so: this was an architecture milestone whose
output was a decision, not a capability. It answered three questions `AK` could not have started
without — whether the workspace displays a directional conclusion (no; a future Strategy engine owns
that vocabulary), whether `decision_support` is adopted or replaced (adopted as-is), and whether the
work splits (it did not need to).

### `AI` — Market Regime Engine v1 · **DONE**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`cd4bb574e3afbedeeb402fbaf2e254a5a9b5f8ca`** |
| **ADR** | [ADR-0025](docs/adr/ADR-0025-market-regime-engine-v1.md) |
| **Design** | [MARKET_REGIME_ENGINE_V1.md](docs/design/MARKET_REGIME_ENGINE_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [MARKET_REGIME_ENGINE_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/MARKET_REGIME_ENGINE_V1_REVIEW.md) — no P0, no P1, **4 P2 fixed**, 3 P3 |
| **Tests** | 3,449 → **3,582** (+133). Mutation 45/45, zero survivors |

**Product value delivered.** The regime call moves out of a prompt and into versioned, testable code.
`fmits regime BTCUSDT` classifies three environments with the evidence behind each, the evidence
against it, what was unavailable, and the exact thresholds used.

**What the owner can now do that was impossible before.** Get a market-environment assessment that is
reproducible, diffable and checkable against history — and see *why* it says what it says, including
where it refuses to say anything. Previously this judgement existed only inside the v3 prompt's STEP 1.

**How the v2 bias is prevented.** Not by review discipline but by construction: evidence votes by
family so correlated indicators cannot corroborate themselves, a threshold band is one number whose
edges are multiplicative mirrors so an asymmetric gate cannot be expressed, and the engine never
learns which way a trend points.

**Limitations shipped with it.** `AI-1` regime is not direction · `AI-2` volatility and participation
each rest on a single evidence family, so neither can be corroborated within its dimension · `AI-3` the
thresholds are stated policy, not measurements · `AI-4` each timeframe is classified alone.

**Status note.** DONE on repository evidence, as §11 rule 3 requires: the commit above exists, the full
suite is green under `-W error`, coverage is 100 % on every module touched, mutation is clean, the
independent review is complete and all three real-data surfaces work.

### `AH` — Confirmation-Delay Provenance v1 · **DONE**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`99483494ea44e00f2c3a8d3256d6288f6c7035c5`** |
| **ADR** | [ADR-0024](docs/adr/ADR-0024-confirmation-delay-provenance.md) |
| **Design** | [CONFIRMATION_DELAY_PROVENANCE_V1.md](docs/design/CONFIRMATION_DELAY_PROVENANCE_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [CONFIRMATION_DELAY_PROVENANCE_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/CONFIRMATION_DELAY_PROVENANCE_V1_REVIEW.md) — no P0, no P1, **2 P2 fixed**, 3 P3 |
| **Tests** | 3,404 → **3,449** (+45). Mutation 42 probes, 41 detected, 1 proven equivalent, 0 no-ops |

**Product value delivered.** **Blocker removed**, as promised — and one reliability improvement the
owner can see. Every break and change of character on a fact sheet is now guaranteed to have been
derived under the confirmation delay detection actually used, because supplying a different one is no
longer expressible. ADR-0020 D1 is closed and has left the printed limitations: `fmits facts`
now shows five rather than six, and `fmits mtf` eight rather than nine.

**What the owner can now do that was impossible before.** Nothing new directly — this was a
blocker-removal milestone under the product-first rule, and it says so. What changed is that a whole
class of silently wrong output is gone: 36.1 % of 300 seeded series produced materially different
breaks under a mismatched delay, and none of them raised an error.

**How.** The delay is stamped where it is known and travels with the facts: `detect_swings` records
`right_bars` on every `SwingPoint`, `structural_levels` copies it onto every `LevelOrigin`, and
`derive_structure_breaks` reads `origin.knowable_from`. The argument is **removed** from every public
entry point rather than validated, so the mismatch is unrepresentable.

**Acceptance, against what was written before the work started.** The delay is carried on a derived
fact from detection through to `LevelOrigin` ✓ · a mismatch is impossible rather than merely rejected
✓ · existing tests pass with documented widening ✓ (80 construction sites migrated, two import guards
made docstring-aware, bar-0 fixtures shifted) · the explicitly rejected `structural_levels` parameter
was rejected again ✓.

**Cost, against the estimate.** `SwingPoint` was constructed at 69 test sites as predicted, plus 11
`LevelOrigin` sites; the migration was done by AST position rather than by hand.

**Limitations shipped with it.** One derivation cannot span two confirmation windows — rejected
loudly · `left_bars` is not carried, because no consumer reads it · a hand-built `PriceLevel` may
still carry no origin and is rejected at the break layer rather than at construction.

**Status note.** DONE on repository evidence, as §11 rule 3 requires: the commit above exists, the
full suite is green under `-W error`, mutation is clean, the independent review is complete and both
real-data smoke tests are valid.

### `AG` — Multi-Timeframe Fact Sheet v1 · **DONE**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`e589411eb575f91ff017713ffc5ed35c094942bb`** |
| **ADR** | [ADR-0023](docs/adr/ADR-0023-multi-timeframe-composition.md) |
| **Design** | [MULTI_TIMEFRAME_FACT_SHEET_V1.md](docs/design/MULTI_TIMEFRAME_FACT_SHEET_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [MULTI_TIMEFRAME_FACT_SHEET_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/MULTI_TIMEFRAME_FACT_SHEET_V1_REVIEW.md) — no P0, no P1, **2 P2 fixed**, 3 P3 |
| **Tests** | 3,305 → **3,404** (+99). Mutation 42/42, zero survivors |

**Product value delivered.** The daily swing workflow's deterministic step is complete. AF's
single-timeframe sheet could mislead — live on BTCUSDT, 1W `sustained_higher` while 4H read
`sustained_lower` — and `PROJECT_SPECIFICATION_V1.md` §5 names that combination as the case that must
not be flattened.

**What the owner can now do that was impossible before.** Run one command and see 1W context, 1D setup
and 4H execution side by side, each labelled with its role and carrying its own `as_of` and staleness
— instead of running three commands and reconciling them mentally, or reading one and being misled.

**Limitations shipped with it.** No cross-timeframe synthesis, deliberately · views are not aligned in
time · `ema_200` may warm up on a weekly view · plus all six inherited from AF, including ADR-0020 D1
still contained rather than fixed.

**Status note.** DONE on repository evidence, as §11 rule 3 requires: the commit above exists, the
full suite is green, mutation is clean and the independent review is complete.

### `AF` — First Light / Structural Fact Sheet v1 · **DONE**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`1505dd8a4e95f25a5cd876e9cfa7ca89f1b86acd`** |
| **Pushed in** | `ea865bd` range, live on `origin/main` |
| **ADR** | [ADR-0022](docs/adr/ADR-0022-structural-fact-sheet-composition-root.md) |
| **Design** | [STRUCTURAL_FACT_SHEET_V1.md](docs/design/STRUCTURAL_FACT_SHEET_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [STRUCTURAL_FACT_SHEET_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/STRUCTURAL_FACT_SHEET_V1_REVIEW.md) — no P0, no P1, **1 P2 fixed**, 4 P3 |
| **Tests** | 3,221 → **3,305** (+84). Mutation 39/39, zero survivors |

**Product value delivered.** The first user-visible capability in the project's history. Before AF,
51.2 % of the codebase was unreachable from real market data and the only working analysis tool was a
prompt that estimated every value visually.

**What the owner can now do that was impossible before.** Obtain computed indicator values, swing
structure, structural trend, price levels, breaks of structure and changes of character for a real
instrument from live exchange data, via one command — the moment
`PROJECT_SPECIFICATION_V1.md` §3.1 became operational.

**Limitations shipped with it.** Single timeframe · one provider · crypto only · no persistence ·
text output only · ADR-0020 D1 contained, not fixed.

### `AE` — Change of Character Foundation v1 · **DONE** *(foundational)*

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`d132ceafc4048b89205772524bf192e3c7bc7b4b`** (merge) · implementation `7276918` |
| **ADR** | [ADR-0021](docs/adr/ADR-0021-change-of-character-foundation-v1.md) |
| **Design** | [CHOCH_FOUNDATION_V1.md](docs/design/CHOCH_FOUNDATION_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [CHOCH_FOUNDATION_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/CHOCH_FOUNDATION_V1_REVIEW.md) — no P0/P1/P2, 3 P3 |
| **Tests** | **3,221 passing** at that commit. Mutation 59/59, zero survivors |

**Product value delivered.** Completed the deterministic structural chain. **Not directly
user-visible** — no product surface existed at the time. It is the last primitive AF needed.

### `AD` — Break of Structure Foundation v1 · **DONE** *(foundational)*

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Commit** | **`5aac1a3f652ea44e4523e2609e140c18a0b9f121`** (merge) · implementation `458f3ac` |
| **ADR** | [ADR-0020](docs/adr/ADR-0020-break-of-structure-foundation-v1.md) |
| **Design** | [BREAK_OF_STRUCTURE_FOUNDATION_V1.md](docs/design/BREAK_OF_STRUCTURE_FOUNDATION_V1.md) |
| **Review** | [BREAK_OF_STRUCTURE_FOUNDATION_V1_REVIEW.md](docs/reviews/BREAK_OF_STRUCTURE_FOUNDATION_V1_REVIEW.md) — 1 P2 fixed, 1 P3, no P0/P1 |
| **Tests** | **3,033 passing** at that commit. Mutation 42/42, zero survivors |

**Product value delivered.** The first layer built entirely on derived facts. **Not directly
user-visible.** It also *named* the D1 limitation rather than defaulting it away — which is why AH
exists as a scheduled milestone instead of a latent bug.

## 9. Backlog item schema

Every milestone item on this board carries these fields. Epic rows in §7 carry the subset that is
known before sequencing.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **ID** | yes | Milestone letter (`AG`) or epic (`EP-04`) |
| **Epic** | yes | Which epic it belongs to |
| **Title** | yes | — |
| **Status** | yes | From §2. Never inferred from a roadmap |
| **Priority** | yes | From §3 |
| **Product Value** | yes | User value delivered, **or** the named blocker removed |
| **User capability unlocked** | yes | Reference the capability ID in `reports/0004` where one exists |
| **Dependencies** | yes | Milestones and open decisions |
| **Acceptance criteria** | yes | Checkable. Cite the contract if one exists rather than restating it |
| **Out of scope** | yes | What must *not* appear in the branch |
| **Related ADRs** | yes | Existing and new |
| **Related reports** | yes | Section-level |
| **Related repository paths** | yes | Files expected to change |
| **Risks** | yes | Concrete, not generic |
| **Estimated size / confidence** | if sourced | Cite the source; never invent an estimate |
| **Product Value Delivered question** | yes | *"What can the owner do after this that was impossible before?"* — answered explicitly |

## 10. Open decisions

Carried, not solved. **D-01 blocks the current NOW item, `AO`** — it is the only one that does.

> **Milestone letters corrected here, 2026-08-04.** Three rows still carried letters from before the
> two shifts recorded in §11, all of them meaning *the daily workflow* under its earlier name. D-01
> read `AL`, which now names the shipped Decision Context Engine; D-05 and D-06 read `AK`, which now
> names the shipped Swing Workspace. The blockers themselves are unchanged: AN shipped deliberately
> without persistence, scheduling or a watchlist model, so all three decisions remain open and now
> point at the epics and the milestone that actually carry them.

| ID | Decision | Blocks | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D-01** | Persistence and serialization schema | EP-18, **`AO`** | `ARCH` §13.8 · `reports/0006` §6 |
| **D-02** | Money / portfolio numeric types (`float` vs `Decimal`) | EP-04 | Review R11 · `reports/0005` §7.2 |
| **D-03** | Availability-time model for released/revised data | EP-07, EP-08 | **ADR-0003 (formal gate)** |
| **D-04** | Journal scope as a formal product capability | EP-18 | `reports/0004` §15.3 |
| **D-05** | Scheduling ownership — belongs to no architecture layer | EP-03 — *not* AN, which shipped without it | `reports/0004` §13.5 |
| **D-06** | Watchlist / universe model | EP-03, `AO` — AN takes its universe from the shell | `reports/0004` §13.5 |
| **D-07** | CI and type-checking timing | EP-20 | `reports/0001` §10.2 |
| **D-08** | Telegram as a delivery transport | EP-19 | `reports/0004` §15.2 |
| **D-09** | Excel / CSV export ecosystem | EP-19 | `reports/0004` §15.2 · blocked by D-01 |
| **D-10** | Tax Center scope | EP-19 | `reports/0004` §15.2 — recommended out of scope |
| **D-11** | Voice interface | EP-19 | `reports/0004` §15.2 |
| **D-12** | AI model routing and budget | EP-20 | `reports/0004` §15.3 |
| **D-13** | Commercial / multi-user direction | — | `reports/0004` §3.2, §15.2 |
| **D-14** | Autonomous strategy modification | Beyond EP-17 | `reports/0003` §7.5 — boundary not crossed |
| **D-15** | Autonomous capital allocation | Beyond EP-17 | `reports/0003` §7.5 — boundary not crossed |

## 11. Backlog maintenance rules

1. **Never delete a completed milestone.** §8 is append-only. A superseded milestone is annotated,
   never removed.
2. **Never change a status silently.** Every status change carries a reason in the same edit.
3. **Every status change must be traceable** to a commit SHA or an explicit owner decision. A
   roadmap, a vision document or a plan is *not* sufficient evidence for DONE.
4. **Roadmap changes require justification.** If this board diverges from
   [`reports/0005`](reports/0005_2026-08-01_FMITS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP_2026_2027.md), say why here.
   Reports are immutable and are never edited to match.
5. **Only one NOW item**, unless a second is genuinely independent — no shared files, no shared
   contracts, no ordering dependency. Independence must be stated, not assumed.
6. **No new milestone without Product Value.** It delivers user value, or it names the blocker it
   removes. "Improves the architecture" is not a product value.
7. **No milestone may bypass the automation ladder.** Research → rules → backtest → robustness →
   paper → shadow → controlled live → bounded autonomy. No rung is skipped for any reason, including
   income pressure.
8. **Architecture work must name the product blocker it removes.** AH is the pattern: it named the
   milestone it unblocks (AI) before the work started, and the DONE row is written against that
   claim rather than around it.

### Milestone letters: two shifts, both recorded

The Decision Context Engine took `AL`, so the two unshipped items below it shifted again: daily
workflow `AL` → **`AN`**, memory `AM` → **`AO`**. Safe only because neither had shipped — no
commit, ADR or design document cites the old letters. `AM` is deliberately left unused rather than
reassigned, so no reader mistakes a renumbered item for the one they remember.

### Milestone letters: the workspace took `AK`

The board previously read `AJ` = Swing Trading Workspace, `AK` = daily workflow, `AL` = memory. The
owner named the workspace **implementation** `AK`, treating `AJ` as the architecture milestone that
preceded it. Both are recorded that way in §8, and the two unshipped items below them shifted one
letter: daily workflow `AK` → **`AL`**, memory `AL` → **`AM`**.

Renumbering is safe here and only here: neither item had shipped, so no commit, ADR or design document
cites the old letters. Nothing above `AJ` was touched.

### Known internal note

[`reports/0006`](reports/0006_2026-08-02_MILESTONE_AF_ARCHITECTURE_GATE.md) §5.2 lists a root
`REPORT.md` among the files AG should update. That file was deleted under explicit authorization on
2026-08-02 and its unique content migrated into
[`reports/README.md`](reports/README.md). **That row is superseded.** Report 0006 is immutable and was
not edited.
