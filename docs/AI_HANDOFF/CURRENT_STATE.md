# Current State

**Snapshot document.** This file records the repository as it is **today**. It is the one document that
should be updated at the end of every milestone. If it disagrees with the code, the code is correct —
update this file.

**Last updated for:** Milestone I-E — Observation Reduction & Alignment Boundary (2026-07-24).
**Latest commit at time of writing:** `5e7e3d5` — `feat(data): enforce canonical UTC timestamps` (the I-E
commit is created by this milestone; update this line to its hash after commit).

## Current milestone

- **I-E — Observation Reduction & Alignment Boundary** (implementation): moves alignment out of
  `fmis.data` into the dedicated `fmis.alignment` policy package
  ([ADR-0002](../adr/ADR-0002-alignment-as-temporal-comparison-policy-layer.md)); adds the pure
  `candle_series_to_observations` reduction (review finding R1); adds the crypto-vs-equity mixed-calendar
  alignment test; corrects the stale alignment docstring (R9). Closes the last infrastructure gap before
  the Relative Value Engine.

## Test count

**247 passing** (`uv run pytest`, ~0.08 s). Per module:

| Module | Tests |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_data_models.py` | 50 |
| `tests/test_observation.py` | 39 |
| `tests/test_reduction.py` | 27 |
| `tests/test_ema.py` | 27 |
| `tests/test_macd.py` | 24 |
| `tests/test_alignment.py` | 24 |
| `tests/test_rsi.py` | 22 |
| `tests/test_atr.py` | 15 |
| `tests/test_features_architecture.py` | 12 |
| `tests/test_ema_math.py` | 5 |
| `tests/test_smoke.py` | 2 |
| **Total** | **247** |

## Implemented indicators (Tier-1)

| Indicator | Class | Warm-up (closed candles) | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| EMA | `ExponentialMovingAverage` | `period` | scalar float |
| ATR | `AverageTrueRange` | `period + 1` | scalar float |
| RSI | `RelativeStrengthIndex` | `period + 1` | scalar float |
| MACD | `MovingAverageConvergenceDivergence` | `slow + signal − 1` (34 for 12/26/9) | immutable mapping `{macd_line, signal_line, histogram}` |

All: closed-candles-only, deterministic, no third-party TA library, explicit insufficient-data state,
provenance in metadata. Each returns **only the latest value**, not the full series (see review finding
R5 — relevant to future backtesting).

## Implemented architecture

- **Pipeline stages present:** *deterministic calculations* (single-instrument, single-timeframe) and
  *canonical series alignment* (multi-series, strict intersection), **now connected** by the
  `candle_series_to_observations` reduction (a candle field → `ObservationSeries`).
- **Canonical models:** `Candle`, `CandleSeries`, `ObservationSeries` (`src/fmis/data/`).
- **Canonical time contract:** every canonical model timestamp must use a *permanent* zero-offset
  timezone; validated, never converted ([ADR-0001](../adr/ADR-0001-canonical-utc-timestamps.md)).
- **Observation reduction:** `candle_series_to_observations(series, field, *, series_id=None)` +
  `CandleField` enum — pure, closed-candles-only, explicit field (no default), no policy.
- **Alignment (policy layer, `fmis.alignment`):** `align_intersection` — strict timestamp intersection
  only, with an immutable `AlignmentResult` / `AlignmentReport` / `SeriesAlignmentStats`. No interpolation,
  forward-fill, resampling, or timezone conversion anywhere. Separate from `fmis.data`
  ([ADR-0002](../adr/ADR-0002-alignment-as-temporal-comparison-policy-layer.md)).
- **Feature Engine:** `FeatureEngine` orchestration; registry-based discovery; topological dependency
  ordering; closed-candle enforcement; immutable `FeatureResult`/`FeatureSet`.
- **Dependency graph:** clean, acyclic, one-directional; `fmis.data` imports nothing from outside
  `fmis.data` (and no longer re-exports alignment, so `fmis.features` no longer pulls it in transitively —
  review finding R12); `fmis.alignment` imports only `fmis.data`; shared kernels (`sources.py`,
  `ema_math.py`, `_timeutils.py`) import nothing internal.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.**

## Placeholder modules (no calculation code)

Under `src/fmis/features/`: `trend/`, `momentum/`, `volatility/`, `volume/`, `market_structure/`,
`support_resistance/`, `pattern_detection/` — each is a docstring + planned-features `TODO` list +
`__all__ = []`. These are the intended homes for the **Planned** Composite Feature Layer.

## Known open items from the architecture review

Full detail in [../ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026-07-24.md](../ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026-07-24.md).

| # | Item | Status / action |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** | `CandleSeries → ObservationSeries` reduction | **Done (I-E)** — `candle_series_to_observations` connects the two pipelines |
| **R2** | Alignment was inside `fmis.data`; D4 places it in a separate module | **Done (I-E)** — moved to `fmis.alignment` ([ADR-0002](../adr/ADR-0002-alignment-as-temporal-comparison-policy-layer.md)) |
| R9 | Stale `alignment.py` timezone docstring | **Done (I-E)** — rewritten for the canonical-UTC contract |
| R12 | `fmis.features` transitively imported alignment via `fmis.data` | **Done (I-E)** — resolved by removing the `fmis.data` re-export |
| — | Mixed-calendar (7-day vs 5-day) alignment test | **Done (I-E)** — `tests/test_alignment.py` |
| **R3** | No knowledge/availability-time dimension, so the documented look-ahead guarantee is not currently provided | **Decided (deferred)** — macro/vintage data gated until an availability-time model is designed and accepted ([ADR-0003](../adr/ADR-0003-availability-time-boundary.md)); that model is a required precursor milestone |
| R5 | Features return only the latest value → backtesting would be O(N²) | No action now; the additive `compute_series()` path is the recorded intent, to be addressed before serious backtesting performance work |
| R11 | The `float` numeric choice was scoped to market data only | Money/portfolio/risk types require their **own ADR** before those modules are built — not inherited by default |

## Immediate next milestone

**Milestone J — RVE v1a** (indexed performance, simple ratio, log ratio), designed in full in
[../RVE_DESIGN_V1.md](../RVE_DESIGN_V1.md). Its two prerequisites (R1 reduction, R2 alignment boundary) are
now satisfied by Milestone I-E, so it is unblocked. New package `fmis.relative_value/`, consuming
`ObservationSeries` (via `candle_series_to_observations`) and `fmis.alignment.align_intersection`.

**Required precursor milestone (not near-term):** an **availability-time model** must be designed and
accepted before any macroeconomic, fundamental-release, revised, or vintage-data backtesting
([ADR-0003](../adr/ADR-0003-availability-time-boundary.md)).

## Current branch expectations

- Work on `main` (single-developer flow to date).
- Each milestone is one implementation → audit → commit → push cycle; the working tree is expected to be
  clean between milestones and `main` in sync with `origin/main`.

## Repository status

- Working tree clean; `main` in sync with `origin/main` at the last completed (pushed) milestone.
- TradingView MCP workflow is external to the Python package — **zero coupling to `src/`**.

## Latest architecture commit

`2fbe662` — `docs(architecture): define FMITS architecture and development roadmap`
([../ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROADMAP_V1.md](../ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROADMAP_V1.md)), as amended by the review record
[../ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026-07-24.md](../ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026-07-24.md) §5.

## Known future roadmap (from the architecture document)

**Planned / near-term:** J/K/L (Relative Value Engine v1: indexed
performance & ratio → relative returns & rolling correlation → z-score & relative momentum) → M
(Composite Feature foundation) → N (Market Regime foundation).

**Deferred:** provider adapters (incl. TradingView ingestion), macro/news/on-chain/derivatives
intelligence, ETF-flow / insider / China / IPO engines, Daily Brief & Opportunity Scanner, persistence,
APIs, dashboards, paper trading, shadow mode, execution, ML, graph/network analysis, cointegration,
causal inference.

See [../ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROADMAP_V1.md](../ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROADMAP_V1.md) §10–§11 for full detail.
